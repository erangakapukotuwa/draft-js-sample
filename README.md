# draft-js-sample

DayView file is the parent Commponent.

I have included the DraftField component into the DayView Component. The Editor Plugin is locatd in this component.

AddEvent(The action save data into the database) is included inside the parent Component. 

I have integrate following features into the Editor

01. Emoji Plugin
02. Mentions Plugin
03. Key Commands for Bold, Italic and Underline

All the above functions are working fine. I have faced to this issue, only when I am saving the data. My database is Mongo.
