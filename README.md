# draft-js-sample

DayView file is the parent Commponent.

I have included the DraftField component into the DayView Component. The Editor Plugin is locatd in this component.

AddEvent(The action save data into the database) is included inside the parent Component. 

EditEvent(The action to edit data into the database) is included inside the parent Component. 

I have integrate following features into the Editor.

01. Emoji Plugin
02. Mentions Plugin
03. Key Commands for Bold, Italic and Underline

All the above functions are working fine. When we click on edit, data is rendered to the editor without styles. Just plain text. Emojis and Mentions styles are missing.
